How to Download and Organize the Dataset
Download the Datasets

Visit the following Kaggle dataset links and download the datasets:
SARS-COV-2 CT Scan Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset
COVID-CT Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisblanche/covidct
Organize the Dataset into One Folder

Create a main folder named COVID-19_Lung_CT_Scans in your desired directory.
Inside this folder, create four subfolders to organize the images:
COVID-19: For COVID-positive images from both datasets.
Non-COVID-19: For non-COVID images from both datasets.
CT_COVID: Specific to COVID-positive images from the COVID-CT dataset.
CT_NonCOVID: Specific to non-COVID images from the COVID-CT dataset.
Steps to Move Files

Extract the downloaded datasets into temporary folders.
Move the COVID-positive images to the COVID-19 and CT_COVID folders.
Move the non-COVID images to the Non-COVID-19 and CT_NonCOVID folders.
Ensure all images are saved in .png or .jpg format.
Verify Folder Structure


Additional Notes
Ensure consistent naming conventions for the files in each folder.
Verify the integrity of the images after moving to ensure no files are corrupted.
Use this folder structure as the root directory for all data preprocessing and training scripts.
